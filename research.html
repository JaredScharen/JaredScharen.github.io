        These are the current dolphins I'm training, Manchengo and Carlos. Manchengo is a rare Spanish breed, and is a distant cousin of Carlos. The third dolphin in the background is a dolphin I previously trained, Spike. Carlos and Manchengo are very unique:

     	<div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
        <li>Manchengo had been conditioned by humans in the region to eat only rare cheeses. We tracked his genes and realized how stunnningly similar they were to those of Carlos, and actually found they have nearly identical dorsal fin placements, leading us to our hypothesis that they are somehow related. We have thus had to prevent mating among the two.

  		<div class="col-md-6">
        <li>Carlos' previous owner, Art Hughes, led Carlos to think he was a dog even though he was clearly a dolphin. Carlos has thus been conditioned to eat dog treats instead of fish and has experienced severe malnutrition. He also had trouble echoing, as he reverted more to a type of barking that comes out as an echo, a new term I have coined "barkhoing". Luckily the damage has not been irreversible, as Carlos is a dolphin and is clearly much smarter than his previous owner, Art, who is clearly deranged.

      	These rare cases allow me to fully appreciate my work, and understand the rare problems dolphins face in the world. Manchengo and Carlos are both nearly back to normal, although Manchengo refuses to eat Sunfish and only consumes more fine fish, likely a result of the fine cheese he was conditioned to. I won't rest until he is a fully normal dolphin.
