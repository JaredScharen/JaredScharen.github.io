      <p>
        Jared was born in Pawksutney, PA, to a family of groundhogs, when he was taken from his home by a family of deranged dolphins. The dolphins names' were Chip and enDale. They believed in eating 15 granola bars per day as a balanced diet. As Jared lived among the dolphis in the Great Caspian Sea, he learned more of their strange habits and the danger these deranged dolphins were imposing upon themselves. He thus dedicated his life to training them, and after training dolphins so moronic to live like normal dolphis but with super duper tricks, training other dolphins was a walk in the park.

        Jared now resides with an alligator the size of Lochness in Lake Placid. He hopes to expand his dolphin training to others passionate about dolphins.
